The grasslands are found where rainfall is about 25-75 cm
per year, not enough to support a forest, but more than
that of a true desert.
Typical grasslands are vegetation formations that are gen-
erally found in temperate climates.
In India, they are found mainly in the high Himalayas.
The
rest of India’s grasslands are mainly composed of steppes
and savannas.
The major difference between steppes and savannas is that

wet season whereas in the savannas forage is largely from
grasses that not only grow during the wet season but also
from the smaller amount of regrowth in the dry season.

Input Tokens for False Statements (Environment - Unknown Chapter - Radiations from radioactive sources, including X-rays and cosmic rays, pose significant health risks, causing both short-range effects like skin burns and long-range effects such as mutations, tumors, and shortened lifespans. Ionizing radiation has a high penetration ability, damaging macro molecules and affecting rapidly dividing cells, making embryos and bone marrow particularly vulnerable. To mitigate these risks, safe disposal methods for radioactive waste and electronic waste (e-waste) are essential. E-waste comprises discarded electronic products and can be hazardous if not properly recycled. Safe practices include scientific recycling methods to avoid environmental contamination. Additionally, the concepts of warm-blooded and cold-blooded are crucial in understanding animal physiology, influencing their adaptation to environmental conditions, with habitat fragmentation posing further threats to biodiversity.): 720

The depth of this zone varies based on water transparency, significantly influencing dissolved oxygen levels, which are less soluble in warmer waters. This zone supports diverse organisms, including fish and zooplankton. In the context of climate action, Fiji's COP conference emphasized the role of local communities and women in disaster response and resilience against climate impacts. Additionally, the E-Waste Management Rules of 2016 introduced the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), mandating producers to manage their e-waste effectively.

Input Tokens for False Statements (Environment - Unknown Chapter - Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are crucial for understanding the potential effects of proposed projects on ecosystems and should be based on comprehensive studies extending over at least one year. Current practices, which often rely on data from a single season, are inadequate for capturing the full environmental implications. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) is urged to enhance its regional presence to improve oversight. Additionally, the Forest Rights Act defines "minor forest produce" to encompass non-timber resources and allows for the diversion of forest land for essential infrastructure, including schools and roads, with special provisions for states with unique challenges, like those in the Himalayan and Northeastern regions, where funding ratios for forest projects are adjusted to 90:10.
